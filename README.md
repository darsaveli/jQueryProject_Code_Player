Inspired by: https://jsbin.com/

<b>Code Player</b> is a simplified version of jsbin and has all the core functionality that is HTML, CSS, Javascript and output panels, which appear and disappear as you click on toggle buttons at the top. Console is missed out. <br>
Just like jsbin as soon as the changes are made in the HTML, Javascript or CSS panels, it's updated immediately in the output window.
